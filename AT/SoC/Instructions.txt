This presumes you can use a bit of grey matter and a soldering iron.....


Once you have programmed the ESP8266 connect everything as follows
solder where required or use breadboard etc.....

This is using the original sketch pin (GPIO_2, internal pin 4), as is the code.......



SS8050 Collector  ---- LED - (minus)

SS8050 Emmiter    ---- Gnd

GPIO_2            ---- SS8050 Base

Vcc               ---- 3v LDO Vout

CH_PD             ---- Vcc

Gnd               ---- Gnd

5V LDO Vout       ---- 3v LDO Vin

5V LDO Vin        ---- 12V from PSU

LED + (PLUS)      ---- 12V From PSU

Gnd from PSU      ---- All Gnd (incl. both LDO's)

I would suggest some Hot Melt glue to secure things but... 


!!!!!!   STAY AWAY FROM THE ANTENNA  !!!!!!
