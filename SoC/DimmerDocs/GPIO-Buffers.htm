<P>The NPN on the 12V are important(1500mA, 40V) but he PNP on the 3v can be swapped for what you have, I have used BC320 amongst others.</P>

<P>I have had this type of circuit talking to a VT101 DECTerminal.</P>

<P>Reset GPIO_16 needs to be “PULLED_UP” at all times the only way for the pin to be low is when 0 is Written as an output, the circuit above has a “leakage path” to ground which is unsuitable for the reset pin GPIO_16.</P>

<P>The circuit below shows GPIO_16 with an additional inverter transistor as an output.</P>
<P>This can be used on any pin, with the inverter The RED channel stays on until the CODE starts,</P>
<P>The GREEN and BLUE come on then fade.</P>

<P>The Circuit below is the same as above but no inverter stage, Invert the code  for GPIO Pin - “PWM Write (PWM Resolution - PWM write value)”. No RED component active until Code starts.</P>
<P>Additional parts are required for Relays.</P>
